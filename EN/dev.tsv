1- O
Yes, B-Claim

3- O
It B-Claim

We B-Claim
are I-Claim
asked I-Claim
about I-Claim
the I-Claim
first I-Claim
choice I-Claim
treatment I-Claim
for I-Claim
glaucoma. I-Claim

In B-Claim
the I-Claim
past, I-Claim
beta-blockers I-Claim
were I-Claim
the I-Claim
first I-Claim
choice, I-Claim
but I-Claim
nowadays I-Claim
they I-Claim
have I-Claim
been I-Claim
displaced I-Claim
by I-Claim
the I-Claim
group I-Claim
that I-Claim
lowers I-Claim
intraocular I-Claim
pressure I-Claim
the I-Claim
most: I-Claim
prostaglandins. I-Claim

Their B-Claim
efficacy I-Claim
and I-Claim
more I-Claim
convenient I-Claim
dosage I-Claim
(once I-Claim
a I-Claim
day) I-Claim
generally I-Claim
make I-Claim
them I-Claim
the I-Claim
group I-Claim
of I-Claim
choice. I-Claim

Beta-blockers B-Claim
would I-Claim
remain I-Claim
as I-Claim
a I-Claim
second I-Claim
choice I-Claim
in I-Claim
cases I-Claim
in I-Claim
which I-Claim
the I-Claim
side I-Claim
effects I-Claim
of I-Claim
prostaglandins I-Claim
(change I-Claim

eye I-Claim

increase I-Claim
in I-Claim
eyelash I-Claim
size) I-Claim
make I-Claim
us I-Claim
initially I-Claim
leave I-Claim
them I-Claim
aside. I-Claim

Since B-Claim
the I-Claim
patient I-Claim
is I-Claim
asthmatic, I-Claim
we I-Claim
should I-Claim
rule I-Claim
out I-Claim
beta-blockers I-Claim
(wrong I-Claim
answer I-Claim
2). I-Claim

Also, B-Claim
since I-Claim
we I-Claim
need I-Claim
a I-Claim
significant I-Claim
drop I-Claim
in I-Claim
intraocular I-Claim
pressure I-Claim
because I-Claim
the I-Claim
numbers I-Claim
are I-Claim
high I-Claim
(34 I-Claim
and I-Claim
31), I-Claim
we I-Claim
can I-Claim
also I-Claim
rule I-Claim
out I-Claim
carbonic I-Claim
anhydrase I-Claim
inhibitors I-Claim
and I-Claim
alpha-2 I-Claim
agonists I-Claim
(options I-Claim
1 I-Claim

3 I-Claim
incorrect). I-Claim

And B-Claim
opt I-Claim
for I-Claim
the I-Claim
group I-Claim
that I-Claim

lower I-Claim
intraocular I-Claim

The B-Claim
femoral I-Claim
nerve I-Claim
(although I-Claim
rare) I-Claim
may I-Claim
be I-Claim
damaged I-Claim
in I-Claim
a I-Claim
cesarean I-Claim
section, I-Claim
hysterectomy I-Claim
or I-Claim
lower I-Claim
abdominal I-Claim
operation. I-Claim

This B-Claim
nerve I-Claim
injury I-Claim
produces I-Claim
hypoesthesia I-Claim
and I-Claim
weakness I-Claim
along I-Claim
its I-Claim
distribution. I-Claim

Femoroneuropathy B-Claim
is I-Claim
manifested I-Claim

the I-Claim

patellar I-Claim
reflexes I-Claim
and I-Claim
hypoesthesia I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
anterior I-Claim

inner I-Claim
thigh. I-Claim

Therefore, B-Claim
answer I-Claim
1 I-Claim
is I-Claim
correct. I-Claim

The B-Claim
femoral I-Claim
cutaneous I-Claim
or I-Claim
lateral I-Claim
femoral I-Claim
cutaneous I-Claim
nerve I-Claim
(L2,L3) I-Claim
is I-Claim
only I-Claim
sensitive I-Claim

is I-Claim
responsible I-Claim
for I-Claim
the I-Claim
sensitivity I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim

the I-Claim

anterior I-Claim
aspect I-Claim

the I-Claim

so O

and O
2 B-Claim

false. I-Claim

The B-Claim
obturator I-Claim
nerve I-Claim
(L2-L4) I-Claim
is I-Claim
a I-Claim
mixed I-Claim

At B-Claim
the I-Claim
motor I-Claim

it I-Claim
invests I-Claim
the I-Claim
obturator I-Claim
externus, I-Claim
pectineus, I-Claim

Answer B-Claim
1 I-Claim
correct: I-Claim
The B-Claim
Thessaly I-Claim
test I-Claim
is I-Claim
a I-Claim
meniscal I-Claim
exploration I-Claim
maneuver. I-Claim

The B-Premise
statement I-Premise
focuses I-Premise
exclusively I-Premise
on I-Premise
this I-Premise
part I-Premise
of I-Premise
the I-Premise
examination I-Premise
and I-Premise
also I-Premise
explains I-Premise
that I-Premise
it I-Premise
is I-Premise
indeed I-Premise
positive, I-Premise
which B-Claim
leads I-Claim
to I-Claim
the I-Claim
suspicion I-Claim
of I-Claim
a I-Claim
meniscal I-Claim
lesion. I-Claim

"The B-Claim
Thessaly I-Claim
test I-Claim
is I-Claim
a I-Claim
dynamic I-Claim
reproduction I-Claim
of I-Claim
load I-Claim
transmission I-Claim

the I-Claim
knee I-Claim

performed I-Claim
at I-Claim
5° I-Claim
and I-Claim
20° I-Claim

flexion. I-Claim

The B-Claim
examiner I-Claim
supports I-Claim
the I-Claim
patient I-Claim
by I-Claim
holding I-Claim
his I-Claim
or I-Claim
her I-Claim
outstretched I-Claim
hands I-Claim
while I-Claim
the I-Claim
patient I-Claim
stands I-Claim
flatfooted I-Claim
on I-Claim
the I-Claim
floor. I-Claim

The B-Claim
patient I-Claim
then I-Claim
rotates I-Claim
his I-Claim
or I-Claim
her I-Claim
knee I-Claim
and I-Claim
body, I-Claim
internally I-Claim
and I-Claim
externally, I-Claim
three I-Claim
times, I-Claim
keeping I-Claim
the I-Claim
knee I-Claim

(5°). I-Claim

Then B-Claim
the I-Claim

may I-Claim

a I-Claim
sense I-Claim
of I-Claim
locking I-Claim

catching. I-Claim

The B-Claim
theory I-Claim
behind I-Claim

that, I-Claim

this I-Claim

the I-Claim

The B-Claim
test I-Claim
is I-Claim
always I-Claim
performed I-Claim
first I-Claim
on I-Claim
the I-Claim
normal I-Claim
knee I-Claim
so I-Claim
that I-Claim

especially I-Claim

regard I-Claim

The B-Claim
most I-Claim
