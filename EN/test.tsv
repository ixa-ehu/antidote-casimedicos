and I-Claim
the I-Claim
peripheral I-Claim
blood I-Claim
smear I-Claim
"smells" I-Claim
like I-Claim
hemolytic I-Claim
anemia. I-Claim

Answer B-Claim
1 I-Claim
cannot I-Claim
be I-Claim
because I-Claim
a I-Claim
marrow I-Claim
aplasia I-Claim
does I-Claim
not I-Claim
explain I-Claim
the I-Claim
choluria, I-Claim
the I-Claim
elevation I-Claim

LDH, I-Claim
nor I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim
study I-Claim

is I-Claim
positive I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim
form I-Claim

panagglutinin; I-Claim
an B-Claim
aplasia I-Claim

In B-Claim
addition, I-Claim
pancytopenia I-Claim

which I-Claim
is I-Claim
what I-Claim
would I-Claim
incline I-Claim
us I-Claim
more I-Claim
towards I-Claim
this I-Claim
pathology. I-Claim

Answer B-Claim
2 I-Claim
is I-Claim
not I-Claim
possible I-Claim
either, I-Claim
since I-Claim
a I-Claim
spherocytosis I-Claim
does I-Claim
not I-Claim
justify I-Claim
the I-Claim
presence I-Claim

panagglutinin. I-Claim

Answer B-Claim
3 I-Claim
is I-Claim
the I-Claim
one I-Claim
I I-Claim
consider I-Claim
correct: I-Claim
an I-Claim
autoimmune I-Claim
hemolytic I-Claim
anemia I-Claim
would I-Claim
justify I-Claim
the I-Claim
data I-Claim
given: I-Claim
elevated I-Claim
LDH I-Claim
and I-Claim
bilirubinemia I-Claim
due I-Claim
to I-Claim
red I-Claim
cell I-Claim
destruction, I-Claim
polychromatophilia, I-Claim
spherocytosis I-Claim
and I-Claim
anisocytosis I-Claim
because I-Claim
the I-Claim
marrow I-Claim
is I-Claim
working I-Claim
hard I-Claim
to I-Claim
try I-Claim
to I-Claim
compensate I-Claim
for I-Claim
the I-Claim
anemia, I-Claim
which I-Claim

regenerative. I-Claim

The B-Claim
study I-Claim
of I-Claim
irregular I-Claim
antibodies I-Claim
and I-Claim
the I-Claim
presence I-Claim
of I-Claim
panagglutinin I-Claim
also I-Claim
supports I-Claim
this I-Claim
response, I-Claim
since I-Claim
the I-Claim
binding I-Claim
of I-Claim
an I-Claim
antibody I-Claim

the I-Claim
hematocyte I-Claim
promotes I-Claim
its I-Claim

Answer B-Claim
4 I-Claim
gives I-Claim
rise I-Claim
to I-Claim
considerable I-Claim
doubt; I-Claim
it I-Claim
is I-Claim
not I-Claim
possible I-Claim
because I-Claim
a I-Claim
pernicious I-Claim
anemia I-Claim
does I-Claim
not I-Claim
justify I-Claim
the I-Claim
presence I-Claim
of I-Claim
panagglutinin I-Claim
although I-Claim
it I-Claim
would I-Claim
justify I-Claim
the I-Claim
elevation I-Claim
of I-Claim
LDH I-Claim
and I-Claim
bilirubin; I-Claim
moreover, I-Claim
it I-Claim
is I-Claim
an I-Claim

no I-Claim
reticulocytosis I-Claim

forms I-Claim
in I-Claim
an I-Claim
attempt I-Claim
to I-Claim
compensate I-Claim
and I-Claim
fix I-Claim
the I-Claim
situation. I-Claim

Answer B-Claim
5 I-Claim
is I-Claim
not I-Claim
true I-Claim
because I-Claim
no I-Claim
blasts I-Claim
are I-Claim
seen I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim

do I-Claim
a I-Claim

measure I-Claim
nocturnal I-Claim

If B-Claim
hypercortisolism I-Claim

confirmed, I-Claim
the I-Claim
origin I-Claim
should I-Claim
be I-Claim

the B-Claim

the I-Claim

suppressed I-Claim

Paroxysmal B-Claim
