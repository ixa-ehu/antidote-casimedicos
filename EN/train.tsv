the B-Claim
first I-Claim
thing I-Claim
that I-Claim
comes I-Claim
to I-Claim
mind I-Claim
is I-Claim
that I-Claim
it I-Claim
is I-Claim
an I-Claim
arregenerative I-Claim

since I-Claim

in I-Claim
this I-Claim

we I-Claim
have I-Claim
already I-Claim
eliminated I-Claim
the I-Claim
options I-Claim
that I-Claim
speak I-Claim

The B-Claim
next I-Claim
thing I-Claim
that I-Claim
orients I-Claim
us I-Claim
towards I-Claim
the I-Claim
cause I-Claim
is I-Claim
that I-Claim
it I-Claim

microcytic I-Claim
and I-Claim
hypochromic, I-Claim
which I-Claim
is I-Claim
characteristic I-Claim
of I-Claim
iron I-Claim
deficiency I-Claim
anemia, I-Claim
since I-Claim
folic I-Claim
deficiency I-Claim
gives I-Claim
rise I-Claim
to I-Claim
megaloblastic I-Claim
anemia I-Claim
and I-Claim
active I-Claim
hemorrhage I-Claim
does I-Claim

there I-Claim
remains I-Claim
answer I-Claim
1, I-Claim
"thalassemic I-Claim

which I-Claim
makes I-Claim
us I-Claim
uncomfortable I-Claim
and I-Claim
makes I-Claim

The B-Claim

is I-Claim
somewhat I-Claim
controversial I-Claim
(some I-Claim
guidelines I-Claim
advise I-Claim
using I-Claim
glucose I-Claim

it...) I-Claim
so O
I B-Claim
have I-Claim
decided I-Claim
to I-Claim
rely I-Claim
on I-Claim
the I-Claim
treatment I-Claim
recommended I-Claim
by I-Claim
Harrison, I-Claim
which I-Claim
is I-Claim
the I-Claim
manual I-Claim
that I-Claim
MIR I-Claim
examiners I-Claim
usually I-Claim
rely I-Claim
on. I-Claim

girl I-Claim
presents I-Claim
with I-Claim
hypernatremia I-Claim
due I-Claim
to I-Claim
extrarenal I-Claim

losses. I-Claim

The B-Claim
goal I-Claim
is I-Claim
to I-Claim
replace I-Claim
the I-Claim
lost I-Claim
water I-Claim
and I-Claim
reduce I-Claim
the I-Claim

at I-Claim
a I-Claim
rate I-Claim
of I-Claim
no I-Claim
more I-Claim
than I-Claim
12 I-Claim
mmol/day. I-Claim

To B-Claim
calculate I-Claim
fluid I-Claim
therapy, I-Claim
the I-Claim

must I-Claim
first I-Claim
be I-Claim
calculated. I-Claim

In B-Claim
this I-Claim

the I-Claim

is: I-Claim

not I-Claim
an I-Claim

We B-Premise

This B-Claim

should I-Claim
automatically I-Claim
lead I-Claim
us I-Claim
to I-Claim
mark I-Claim
epiphysiolysis I-Claim
capitis I-Claim

(proximal I-Claim
femoral I-Claim
epiphysiolysis, I-Claim
the I-Claim
fact I-Claim
of I-Claim
reading I-Claim
it I-Claim
in I-Claim
Latin I-Claim
nomina I-Claim
is I-Claim
a I-Claim
bit I-Claim
of I-Claim
a I-Claim
misunderstanding I-Claim
but I-Claim
it I-Claim
should I-Claim
not I-Claim
mislead I-Claim
us). I-Claim

We B-Claim
should I-Claim
think I-Claim
of I-Claim
this I-Claim
one I-Claim
because I-Claim
it I-Claim
is I-Claim
the I-Claim
most I-Claim
frequent I-Claim
and I-Claim
possible I-Claim
(correct I-Claim
answer I-Claim
2). I-Claim

The B-Claim
other I-Claim
options I-Claim
are I-Claim
not I-Claim
impossible I-Claim
but I-Claim
they I-Claim
are I-Claim
less I-Claim
frequent I-Claim
and I-Claim
they I-Claim
would I-Claim
not I-Claim
ask I-Claim
us I-Claim
this I-Claim
if I-Claim
they I-Claim
wanted I-Claim
us I-Claim
to I-Claim
choose I-Claim
another I-Claim
option. I-Claim

If B-Claim
they I-Claim
were I-Claim
sequelae I-Claim
of I-Claim
hip I-Claim
dysplasia, I-Claim
it I-Claim
would I-Claim
not I-Claim
have I-Claim
this I-Claim
4-month I-Claim
onset I-Claim
and I-Claim
the I-Claim
age I-Claim
of I-Claim
onset I-Claim
would I-Claim
be I-Claim
earlier. I-Claim

Complications B-Claim
of I-Claim
dysplasia I-Claim
are I-Claim
dislocations I-Claim
and I-Claim
subluxations I-Claim
that I-Claim
may I-Claim
require I-Claim
surgery I-Claim
and I-Claim
avascular I-Claim
necrosis I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
head I-Claim
(false I-Claim
answer I-Claim
5). I-Claim

Perthes B-Claim
disease I-Claim
occurs I-Claim
in I-Claim
younger I-Claim
children I-Claim
(4-9 I-Claim
years) I-Claim
with I-Claim
episodes I-Claim
of I-Claim
limping I-Claim
and I-Claim
pain I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim
hip I-Claim
and I-Claim
knee I-Claim
(false I-Claim
answer I-Claim
4). I-Claim

In B-Claim
a I-Claim
child I-Claim
the I-Claim
most I-Claim
typical I-Claim
would I-Claim
be I-Claim
a I-Claim
fracture I-Claim
at I-Claim
the I-Claim
level I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
physis, I-Claim
not I-Claim
at I-Claim
the I-Claim
level I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
femoral I-Claim
neck, I-Claim
so I-Claim
we I-Claim
discard I-Claim
3. I-Claim

For B-Claim
us I-Claim
to I-Claim
consider I-Claim
this I-Claim
option I-Claim
we I-Claim
would I-Claim
have I-Claim
to I-Claim
have I-Claim
been I-Claim
presented I-Claim
with I-Claim
a I-Claim
bone I-Claim
cyst, I-Claim
something I-Claim
that I-Claim
would I-Claim
justify I-Claim
a I-Claim
weakness I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim
femoral I-Claim
neck I-Claim
area. I-Claim

As B-Claim
for I-Claim
juvenile I-Claim
chronic I-Claim
arthritis, I-Claim
it I-Claim
is I-Claim
a I-Claim
rheumatoid I-Claim
option I-Claim
surrounded I-Claim
by I-Claim
trauma I-Claim
options. I-Claim

They B-Claim
do I-Claim
not I-Claim
speak I-Claim
to I-Claim
us I-Claim
of I-Claim
rheumatologic I-Claim
factors I-Claim
in I-Claim
an I-Claim
analytical I-Claim
analysis, I-Claim
nor I-Claim
of I-Claim
a I-Claim
polyarticular I-Claim
picture. I-Claim

Perhaps B-Claim
we I-Claim
could I-Claim
think I-Claim
about I-Claim
this I-Claim
one I-Claim
because I-Claim
they I-Claim
talk I-Claim
about I-Claim
pain I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim
right I-Claim
knee, I-Claim
but I-Claim
this I-Claim
picture I-Claim
that I-Claim
they I-Claim
present I-Claim
us I-Claim
is I-Claim
limited I-Claim
to I-Claim
the I-Claim
right I-Claim
lower I-Claim
limb, I-Claim
they I-Claim
do I-Claim
not I-Claim
talk I-Claim
about I-Claim
other I-Claim
joints I-Claim
or I-Claim
fever I-Claim
or I-Claim
other I-Claim
accompanying I-Claim
systemic I-Claim
symptoms, I-Claim
so I-Claim
it I-Claim
is I-Claim
not I-Claim
an I-Claim
option I-Claim
to I-Claim
evaluate, I-Claim
especially I-Claim
with I-Claim
the I-Claim
other I-Claim
options I-Claim
presented I-Claim
to I-Claim
us I-Claim
that I-Claim
would I-Claim
be I-Claim
more I-Claim
likely I-Claim
in I-Claim
view I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
picture I-Claim
presented I-Claim
to I-Claim
us I-Claim
(option I-Claim
1 I-Claim
false). I-Claim

In B-Claim
addition, I-Claim
the I-Claim

refers I-Claim

Answer B-Claim
1 I-Claim

2 B-Claim
is I-Claim
absurd: I-Claim

That's B-Claim

3 B-Claim
to I-Claim
5 I-Claim
are I-Claim

revascularization: I-Claim
since I-Claim
it I-Claim

a I-Claim
single I-Claim
vessel I-Claim

not I-Claim
a I-Claim
proximal I-Claim
LAD, I-Claim
revascularization I-Claim
would I-Claim
have I-Claim

percutaneous, I-Claim
so O
we B-Claim

So B-Claim
the I-Claim

a I-Premise
pneumococcus I-Premise

If B-Claim
we I-Claim
analyze I-Claim

remember I-Claim

time, I-Claim
you I-Claim
may I-Claim
encounter I-Claim
a I-Claim
limitation I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
movement I-Claim
of I-Claim
one I-Claim
eye. I-Claim

In B-Premise
this I-Premise
case, I-Premise
when I-Premise
you I-Premise
scan I-Premise
the I-Premise
supraversion, I-Premise
you I-Premise
suspect I-Premise
or I-Premise
you I-Premise
detect I-Premise
a I-Premise
limitation I-Premise
in I-Premise
the I-Premise
movement I-Premise
of I-Premise
the I-Premise
left I-Premise
eye. I-Premise

And B-Claim
we I-Claim
would I-Claim
call I-Claim
this I-Claim
a I-Claim
limitation I-Claim
to I-Claim
the I-Claim
supraversion I-Claim
of I-Claim
that I-Claim
eye. I-Claim

It O
doesn't O
make O
sense O
to O
talk O
about O
limitation O
to O
the O
version O
of O
the O
eyeball, O
because O
the O
version O
is O
always O
of O
both O
eyeballs. O

Okay, O
it O
is O
understood, O
but O
it O
is O
an O
important O
misconception O
that O
should O
not O
be O
made O
by O
the O
person O
writing O
the O
question O
(who O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
an O
expert O
on O
the O
subject), O
but O
well, O
as O
I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
is O
a O
reason O
to O
challenge O
the O
question, O
let's O
go O
on. O

It B-Premise
is I-Premise
about I-Premise
a I-Premise
patient I-Premise
who I-Premise
has I-Premise
received I-Premise
a I-Premise
blow. I-Premise

All O
four O
answers O
are O
fractures, O
so O
we O
have O
a O
pretty O
definite O
picture. O

The B-Premise
palpebral I-Premise
hematoma I-Premise
and I-Premise
hyposphagma I-Premise
(subconjunctival I-Premise
hemorrhage) I-Premise
does I-Premise
not I-Premise
give I-Premise
us I-Premise
the I-Premise
key I-Premise
data. I-Premise

What B-Premise
is I-Premise
important I-Premise
is I-Premise
that I-Premise
the I-Premise
eye I-Premise
that I-Premise
has I-Premise
received I-Premise
the I-Premise
blow I-Premise
does I-Premise
not I-Premise
go I-Premise
up, I-Premise
and O
therefore B-Claim
there I-Claim
is I-Claim
double I-Claim
vision I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim
superior I-Claim
gaze. I-Claim

It B-Claim
might I-Claim
be I-Claim
tempting I-Claim
to I-Claim
answer I-Claim
3, I-Claim
thinking B-Premise
that I-Premise
because I-Premise
the I-Premise
superior I-Premise
rectus I-Premise
is I-Premise
trapped, I-Premise
it I-Premise
does I-Premise
not I-Premise
work I-Premise
and I-Premise
therefore I-Premise
the I-Premise
eye I-Premise
cannot I-Premise
go I-Premise
up. I-Premise

However, B-Claim
muscles I-Claim
trapped I-Claim
in I-Claim
a I-Claim
fracture I-Claim
do I-Claim
not I-Claim
automatically I-Claim
lose I-Claim
their I-Claim
muscular I-Claim
action. I-Claim

What B-Claim
happens I-Claim
is I-Claim
that I-Claim
they I-Claim
become I-Claim
trapped, I-Claim
they I-Claim
are I-Claim
"hooked", I-Claim
and I-Claim
cannot I-Claim
stretch. I-Claim

The B-Claim
problem I-Claim
is I-Claim
that I-Claim
the I-Claim
inferior I-Claim
wall I-Claim
has I-Claim
been I-Claim
broken, I-Claim
the I-Claim
inferior I-Claim
rectus I-Claim
has I-Claim
been I-Claim
trapped, I-Claim
and I-Claim
when I-Claim
the I-Claim
eye I-Claim
must I-Claim
look I-Claim
up, I-Claim
this I-Claim
inferior I-Claim
rectus I-Claim
cannot I-Claim
stretch I-Claim
as I-Claim
it I-Claim
should. I-Claim

It B-Claim
is I-Claim
not I-Claim
paralysis, I-Claim
but I-Claim
a I-Claim
restrictive I-Claim
problem. I-Claim

This O
question O
could O
also O
be O
answered O
by O
discarding. O

Options B-Claim
2 I-Claim
and I-Claim
4 I-Claim
can I-Claim
be I-Claim
ignored I-Claim
because O
they B-Claim
are I-Claim
too I-Claim
far I-Claim
away I-Claim
from I-Claim
the I-Claim
extraocular I-Claim
muscles I-Claim
to I-Claim
produce I-Claim
diplopia. I-Claim

And B-Claim
as I-Claim
for I-Claim
the I-Claim
walls I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
orbit, I-Claim
the I-Claim
ones I-Claim
that I-Claim
break I-Claim
most I-Claim
frequently I-Claim
are I-Claim
the I-Claim
inferior I-Claim
and I-Claim
medial I-Claim
wall. I-Claim

The B-Claim
superior I-Claim
wall I-Claim
ruptures I-Claim
very I-Claim
rarely. I-Claim

catch. O

If O

you O
read O
it O

go O
straight O

what O
you O

it O
right. O

The B-Claim
problem I-Claim
is I-Claim
option I-Claim
4, I-Claim
which I-Claim
can I-Claim
confuse I-Claim
us. I-Claim

Let's O
see: O
we B-Premise
have I-Premise
a I-Premise
blow I-Premise
to I-Premise
the I-Premise
right I-Premise
eye I-Premise
area, I-Premise
with I-Premise
a I-Premise
hematoma I-Premise
on I-Premise
the I-Premise
eyelid. I-Premise

So O
far O
so O
normal. O

The B-Premise
problem I-Premise
is I-Premise
that I-Premise
retinal I-Premise
hemorrhages I-Premise
appear I-Premise
not I-Premise
only I-Premise
in I-Premise
that I-Premise
eye I-Premise
(which I-Premise
in I-Premise
itself I-Premise
is I-Premise
rare, I-Premise
because I-Premise
an I-Premise
external I-Premise
blow I-Premise
to I-Premise
the I-Premise
eye I-Premise
in I-Premise
a I-Premise
child I-Premise
rarely I-Premise
causes I-Premise
bleeding I-Premise
in I-Premise
the I-Premise
retina), I-Premise
but I-Premise
also I-Premise
in I-Premise
the I-Premise
other I-Premise
eye. I-Premise

Therefore, B-Claim
something I-Claim
other I-Claim
than I-Claim
the I-Claim
blow I-Claim
has I-Claim
caused I-Claim
hemorrhages I-Claim
in I-Claim
both I-Claim
retinas. I-Claim

Then B-Premise
we I-Premise
are I-Premise
told I-Premise
that I-Premise
the I-Premise
child I-Premise
seems I-Premise
drowsy I-Premise
and I-Premise
with I-Premise
little I-Premise
tone. I-Premise

Here B-Claim
we I-Claim
already I-Claim
have I-Claim
the I-Claim
two I-Claim
keys; I-Claim
we I-Claim
have I-Claim
to I-Claim
suspect I-Claim
what I-Claim
is I-Claim
not I-Claim
mentioned I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim
answers, I-Claim
but I-Claim
which I-Claim
is I-Claim
what I-Claim
the I-Claim
child I-Claim
has: I-Claim
the I-Claim
shaken I-Claim
baby I-Claim
syndrome I-Claim
(shaken I-Claim
baby I-Claim

Characteristic B-Claim
of I-Claim
this I-Claim
syndrome I-Claim
are I-Claim
bilateral I-Claim
retinal I-Claim
hemorrhages, I-Claim
cerebral I-Claim
edema I-Claim
and I-Claim
subdural I-Claim
hematoma. I-Claim

There B-Claim
may I-Claim

be I-Claim
fracture I-Claim

The B-Claim

It B-Claim

AMD I-Claim
(although B-Claim

in I-Claim
question I-Claim

we I-Claim
would I-Claim

In B-Premise
any I-Premise

we I-Premise

an I-Premise

In B-Premise
the I-Premise

there I-Premise
are I-Premise

With B-Claim
that I-Claim
we I-Claim
can I-Claim
rule I-Claim
out I-Claim
acute I-Claim
posterior I-Claim
vitreous I-Claim

which I-Claim

And B-Claim
also I-Claim

because O
although B-Claim
it I-Claim

typical I-Claim

older I-Claim
people, I-Claim
it I-Claim

And B-Claim
there I-Claim
are I-Claim
no I-Claim
lesions I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim
macula I-Claim
but I-Claim
papilla I-Claim
edema. I-Claim

In B-Claim
central I-Claim
retinal I-Claim

metamorphopsia I-Claim

not I-Claim
particularly I-Claim
characteristic I-Claim

but I-Claim
the I-Claim

In B-Claim

there I-Claim

that I-Claim

absence I-Claim

and I-Claim
a I-Claim

pale I-Claim

In B-Claim
addition, I-Claim
the I-Claim
entire I-Claim
retina I-Claim

and I-Claim
a I-Claim
cherry-red I-Claim

the I-Claim

In B-Claim
this I-Claim
case I-Claim
the I-Claim
lesions I-Claim
are I-Claim
totally I-Claim

They B-Premise
describe I-Premise
hard I-Premise

localized I-Premise
neurosensory I-Premise
retinal I-Premise

All B-Premise
this I-Premise
in I-Premise
the I-Premise

These B-Claim
are I-Claim
the I-Claim

As B-Premise

This B-Premise
behavior, I-Premise
which I-Premise

CORRECT O
ANSWER: O
4 O

In B-Claim
this I-Claim
question I-Claim
they I-Claim
ask I-Claim
for I-Claim
the I-Claim

of I-Claim
the I-Claim

not I-Claim

so O
therefore B-Claim
the I-Claim
correct I-Claim
answer I-Claim
is I-Claim
compulsion. I-Claim

According B-Claim
to I-Claim
the I-Claim
DSM-5, I-Claim
a I-Claim
compulsion I-Claim
is I-Claim
a I-Claim
repetitive I-Claim
behavior I-Claim
(e.g., I-Claim

silently) I-Claim
that I-Claim
the I-Claim

rigidly I-Claim

The B-Claim
goal I-Claim

avoid I-Claim

however, B-Claim
these I-Claim

Characteristic B-Claim
is I-Claim
upper I-Claim
eyelid I-Claim
ptosis I-Claim
and I-Claim
miosis I-Claim
of I-Claim
that I-Claim
eye. I-Claim

This B-Claim
occurs I-Claim
due I-Claim
to I-Claim
a I-Claim
deficit I-Claim
of I-Claim
sympathetic I-Claim
innervation I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
orbital I-Claim
territory. I-Claim

The B-Claim
sympathetic I-Claim
nervous I-Claim
system I-Claim
innervates I-Claim
the I-Claim
Müller I-Claim
muscle, I-Claim
which I-Claim
is I-Claim
an I-Claim
accessory I-Claim
muscle I-Claim
to I-Claim
the I-Claim
levator I-Claim

If B-Claim
the I-Claim
Müller I-Claim
ceases I-Claim

function, I-Claim
the I-Claim
eyelid I-Claim
descends I-Claim
slightly. I-Claim

It B-Claim
also I-Claim
innervates I-Claim
the I-Claim
iris I-Claim
dilator I-Claim
muscle. I-Claim

Therefore, B-Claim
the I-Claim
sphincter I-Claim
muscle, I-Claim
its I-Claim
antagonist, I-Claim
is I-Claim
unopposed I-Claim
and I-Claim
the I-Claim
balance I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
pupil I-Claim

miosis. I-Claim

It B-Claim
explains I-Claim
ptosis I-Claim

miosis I-Claim

we I-Claim

we I-Claim

which I-Claim

a I-Claim

mature I-Claim

20th I-Claim
century. I-Claim

It B-Claim
is I-Claim
so I-Claim
named I-Claim
when I-Claim
the I-Claim
teratoma I-Claim
is I-Claim
predominantly I-Claim
composed I-Claim
of I-Claim
mature I-Claim
thyroid I-Claim
tissue I-Claim
(at I-Claim

be I-Claim
classified I-Claim
as I-Claim
struma I-Claim

It B-Claim
represents I-Claim
between I-Claim
2.5 I-Claim

In B-Claim

a I-Claim
benign I-Claim
tumor, I-Claim
but I-Claim
in I-Claim
up I-Claim

5% I-Claim

a I-Claim

This B-Claim

Clinically, B-Claim
the I-Claim

A B-Claim
new I-Claim
approach I-Claim
is I-Claim
currently I-Claim
being I-Claim
developed I-Claim
for I-Claim
the I-Claim
treatment I-Claim
of I-Claim
these I-Claim
patients, I-Claim
which I-Claim
tries I-Claim
to I-Claim
coordinate I-Claim
from I-Claim
the I-Claim
beginning I-Claim
the I-Claim

of I-Claim
the I-Claim
different I-Claim
sectors I-Claim
involved, I-Claim
avoiding I-Claim

the I-Claim
patient I-Claim

the I-Claim
end I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
treatment I-Claim
of I-Claim
each I-Claim
part. I-Claim

This B-Claim
idea I-Claim
gave I-Claim
rise I-Claim
to I-Claim
the I-Claim
so-called I-Claim
orthogeriatric I-Claim
units", I-Claim
which I-Claim
combine I-Claim

In B-Claim

There B-Claim

no I-Claim

Because B-Claim
if I-Claim

currently I-Claim
treated I-Claim
(ATRA B-Claim
aside... I-Claim
which I-Claim

As B-Claim

In B-Premise
this I-Premise

In B-Premise

CORRECT O
ANSWER: O
1 O

SCA3 O
is O
Spinocerebellar O
Ataxia O
type O
3 O
also O
called O
Machado-Joseph O
disease. O

It O
is O
caused O
by O

The O

In B-Premise
this I-Premise
clinical I-Premise
case, I-Premise
the I-Premise
one I-Premise
who I-Premise
has I-Premise
the I-Premise
disease I-Premise
and I-Premise
has I-Premise
the I-Premise
mutated I-Premise
gene I-Premise
in I-Premise
heterozygosis I-Premise
is I-Premise
the I-Premise
brother I-Premise
(26 I-Premise
years I-Premise
old) I-Premise
of I-Premise
the I-Premise
pregnant I-Premise
woman. I-Premise

I B-Claim
think I-Claim
that I-Claim
before I-Claim
doing I-Claim
the I-Claim
chorion I-Claim
biopsy, I-Claim
the I-Claim
pregnant I-Claim
woman I-Claim
should I-Claim
be I-Claim
tested I-Claim
to I-Claim
know I-Claim
her I-Claim
ATXN3 I-Claim
gene I-Claim
status. I-Claim

She B-Claim
has I-Claim
a I-Claim
50% I-Claim
chance I-Claim
of I-Claim
carrying I-Claim
the I-Claim
mutation I-Claim
and I-Claim
having I-Claim
the I-Claim
disease, I-Claim
but I-Claim
since I-Claim
she I-Claim
is I-Claim
31 I-Claim
years I-Claim
old, I-Claim
I I-Claim
think I-Claim
she I-Claim
should I-Claim
have I-Claim
already I-Claim
had I-Claim
symptoms. I-Claim

Nevertheless, B-Claim
I I-Claim
would I-Claim
do I-Claim
the I-Claim
genetic I-Claim
test I-Claim
on I-Claim
the I-Claim
pregnant I-Claim
woman I-Claim
to I-Claim
be I-Claim
on I-Claim
the I-Claim
safe I-Claim
side. I-Claim

If B-Claim
she I-Claim
came I-Claim
out I-Claim
without I-Claim
the I-Claim
mutation, I-Claim
there I-Claim
would I-Claim
be I-Claim
nothing I-Claim
more I-Claim
to I-Claim
do I-Claim
because I-Claim
the I-Claim
disease I-Claim
would I-Claim
no I-Claim
longer I-Claim
be I-Claim
transmitted. I-Claim

If B-Claim
she I-Claim
came I-Claim
out I-Claim
with I-Claim
the I-Claim
mutation, I-Claim
then I-Claim
I I-Claim
would I-Claim
do I-Claim
a I-Claim
chorionic I-Claim
villus I-Claim
biopsy. I-Claim

Answers B-Claim
1 I-Claim
and I-Claim
2 I-Claim

both I-Claim

CORRECT O
ANSWER: O
1 O

We B-Premise
are I-Premise
presented I-Premise
with I-Premise
a I-Premise
68-year-old I-Premise
female I-Premise
patient. I-Premise

At B-Claim
that I-Claim
age I-Claim
the I-Claim
crystalline I-Claim
lens, I-Claim
although I-Claim
it I-Claim
does I-Claim
not I-Claim
normally I-Claim
have I-Claim
a I-Claim
cataract I-Claim
that I-Claim
needs I-Claim
surgery, I-Claim
it I-Claim
usually I-Claim
has I-Claim
increased I-Claim
in I-Claim
thickness. I-Claim

This B-Claim
implies I-Claim
that I-Claim
it I-Claim
projects I-Claim
the I-Claim
iris I-Claim
forward I-Claim
and I-Claim
reduces I-Claim
the I-Claim
depth I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
anterior I-Claim
chamber. I-Claim

In B-Claim
an I-Claim
eye I-Claim
with I-Claim
a I-Claim
normal I-Claim
anterior I-Claim
chamber I-Claim
depth I-Claim
this I-Claim
is I-Claim
usually I-Claim
not I-Claim
a I-Claim
problem. I-Claim

But B-Claim
farsighted I-Claim
people I-Claim
already I-Claim
have I-Claim
a I-Claim
narrow I-Claim
anterior I-Claim
chamber. I-Claim

This B-Claim
is I-Claim
the I-Claim
usual I-Claim
combination I-Claim
we I-Claim
find I-Claim
in I-Claim
primary I-Claim
angular I-Claim
closure: I-Claim
farsightedness I-Claim
and I-Claim
age I-Claim
over I-Claim
50-60 I-Claim
years. I-Claim

Younger B-Claim
hyperopes I-Claim
usually I-Claim
do I-Claim
not I-Claim
have I-Claim
this I-Claim
problem I-Claim
yet. I-Claim

And B-Claim
neither I-Claim
do I-Claim
older I-Claim
people I-Claim
who I-Claim
are I-Claim
emmetropic, I-Claim
myopic I-Claim
or I-Claim
have I-Claim
had I-Claim
cataract I-Claim
surgery. I-Claim

With B-Claim
this I-Claim
narrow I-Claim
angle, I-Claim
what I-Claim
triggers I-Claim
angular I-Claim
closure I-Claim
is I-Claim
mydriasis. I-Claim

That B-Claim
is, I-Claim
when I-Claim
you I-Claim
are I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim
penumbra, I-Claim
the I-Claim
pupil I-Claim
dilates I-Claim
and I-Claim
the I-Claim
iris I-Claim
thickens I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim
peripheral I-Claim
part, I-Claim
where I-Claim
it I-Claim
is I-Claim
already I-Claim
very I-Claim
close I-Claim
to I-Claim
the I-Claim
corneal I-Claim
endothelium I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim
case I-Claim
of I-Claim
a I-Claim
narrow I-Claim
chamber. I-Claim

Mydriasis B-Claim
then I-Claim
triggers I-Claim
angular I-Claim
closure, I-Claim
which I-Claim
is I-Claim
accompanied I-Claim
by I-Claim
ocular I-Claim
pain I-Claim
that I-Claim
may I-Claim
radiate I-Claim
backwards I-Claim
(headache). I-Claim

And B-Claim
increased I-Claim
intraocular I-Claim
pressure I-Claim
produces I-Claim
corneal I-Claim
edema I-Claim
that I-Claim
causes I-Claim
blurred I-Claim
vision. I-Claim

Therefore, B-Claim
option I-Claim
1 I-Claim
is I-Claim
correct. I-Claim

Migraine B-Claim
does I-Claim
not I-Claim
have I-Claim
to I-Claim
be I-Claim
related I-Claim
to I-Claim
penumbra, I-Claim
and O
ocular B-Claim
pain I-Claim
and I-Claim
blurred I-Claim
vision I-Claim
is I-Claim
not I-Claim
particularly I-Claim
typical. I-Claim

Actinic B-Claim
keratitis I-Claim
is I-Claim
caused I-Claim
by I-Claim
exposure I-Claim
to I-Claim
ultraviolet I-Claim
radiation I-Claim
(such I-Claim
as I-Claim
solar I-Claim
radiation), I-Claim
and I-Claim
is I-Claim
not I-Claim
related I-Claim
to I-Claim
hyperopia I-Claim
or I-Claim
to I-Claim
being I-Claim
in I-Claim
penumbra. I-Claim

In B-Claim
addition, I-Claim
the I-Claim
history I-Claim
of I-Claim
exposure I-Claim
is I-Claim
usually I-Claim
clear. I-Claim

And B-Claim
finally, I-Claim
dry I-Claim
eye I-Claim
does I-Claim
not I-Claim
produce I-Claim
these I-Claim
symptoms I-Claim
either: I-Claim
it I-Claim
is I-Claim
more I-Claim
a I-Claim
question I-Claim
of I-Claim
burning, I-Claim
foreign I-Claim
body I-Claim
sensation, I-Claim
heaviness, I-Claim
etc. I-Claim

And B-Claim
it I-Claim
is I-Claim
also I-Claim
unrelated I-Claim
to I-Claim
the I-Claim
other I-Claim
elements: I-Claim
penumbra, I-Claim
hyperopia, I-Claim
etc. I-Claim

As B-Claim
a I-Claim
minor I-Claim
detail, I-Claim
I I-Claim
would I-Claim
have I-Claim
worded I-Claim
the I-Claim
question I-Claim
a I-Claim
little I-Claim
better. I-Claim

It B-Claim
is I-Claim
understood I-Claim
that I-Claim
we I-Claim
are I-Claim
asked I-Claim
which I-Claim
pathology I-Claim
is I-Claim
the I-Claim
most I-Claim
probable I-Claim
in I-Claim
relation I-Claim
to I-Claim
the I-Claim
symptoms I-Claim
and I-Claim
the I-Claim
anamnesis. I-Claim

But B-Claim
as I-Claim
it I-Claim
is I-Claim
worded, I-Claim
we I-Claim
are I-Claim
asked I-Claim
about I-Claim
which I-Claim
of I-Claim
the I-Claim
pathologies I-Claim
she I-Claim
is I-Claim
most I-Claim

just I-Claim
like I-Claim
that. I-Claim

Actually, B-Claim
a I-Claim

is I-Claim
very I-Claim
likely I-Claim
to I-Claim
have I-Claim
dry I-Claim

even I-Claim
if I-Claim

not I-Claim
cause I-Claim
the I-Claim

which I-Claim

We B-Claim

This B-Claim

coincidence: I-Claim
the I-Claim
fact I-Claim
that I-Claim
the I-Claim

is I-Claim
important, I-Claim
because I-Claim
the I-Claim
eyeballs I-Claim

are I-Claim
shorter, I-Claim
with I-Claim
a I-Claim
certain I-Claim

of I-Claim
space I-Claim
in I-Claim
the I-Claim

In B-Claim

moreover, I-Claim
the I-Claim
